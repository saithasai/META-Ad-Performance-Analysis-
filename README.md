## Key Findings
KPI Metrics    
â€¢ Impressions: 216K: Total times the ads were shown. Good reach.   
â€¢ Clicks: 25.4K: Number of people who clicked on the ads.   
â€¢ Shares: 1.3K, Comments: 2.6K: Indicators of organic engagement (beyond paid reach).   
â€¢ Purchases (Conversions): 1.3K: Real customer acquisitions from ads.    
â€¢ Engagements: 29K: Sum of clicks, likes, shares, comments.   
â€¢ CTR (Click-Through Rate): 11.76%: Strong performance (above industry average ~1-2%). Ads are very attractive.    
â€¢ Engagement Rate: 13.56%: Very healthy; content resonates with the audience.   
â€¢ Conversion Rate: 5.21%: Out of all clicks, 5.21% converted into purchases. Good but could improve with landing page optimization.   
â€¢ Purchase Rate: 0.61%: Out of impressions, only 0.61% resulted in purchases. Low conversion funnel efficiency (room to optimize).    
â€¢ Total Budget: 2.5M: Total ad spends.    
â€¢ Avg Budget per Campaign: 50.7K: Suggests multiple campaigns were run. Ads are performing strongly in visibility and engagement, but actual purchase efficiency is weak: need to optimize targeting/landing pages.   
â€¢ High CTR (11.76%) and Engagement Rate (13.56%) â†’ clearly indicate that the ad creatives, messaging, and targeting at the top of the funnel are very effective. People are interested enough to click, like, share, or comment.    
â€¢ Low Purchase Rate (0.61%) and only 1.3K conversions out of 216K impressions. Shows a sharp drop-off in the lower funnel. This is a classic case of "awareness and interest" being strong but "action (purchase)" being weak.
